# Spotify-Data-Processing
reads the json files provided by spotify

This is mostly just for me, but if you want its really easy to put your own data in here. Order your extended streaming history from spotify and put the files in here. Change the file paths list in the python file and MAKE SURE THEY ARE IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER or the program wont work. OK Enjoy
